peer review - 11:23pm 1/23/24 overall the website looks really good and similar to the figma. its well designed and has good responsiveness. I cant really say where to improve on because it well done for a desktop, moblie and even tablet size. id say the header looks a little weired around 938px size but that isnt included in the requirement so i think its good. overall the code is good he used all tailwind classes and little to no css good job!
